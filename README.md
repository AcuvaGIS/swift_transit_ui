# Swift Transit

**Integrating GTFS Data & GIS for Route Planning in Kenyan Public Transportation**

Swift Transit is a proposed system that aims to improve the public transportation experience in Nairobi by addressing the challenges faced by commuters. The platform will bridge the gap in lack of reliable route and movement information in navigating the vibrant city's road network. User experience, Spatial analytics, and alertness is key to what we aim to do.
